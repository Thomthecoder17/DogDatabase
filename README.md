# DogDatabase
## Description:
A simple Flutter app to keep track of the number of dogs at a dog park. Dogs are manually "signed in" to a dog park by inputting the dog park's name, the number of dogs, and the names of the dogs. Signed in dogs will be visible to other users who are planning to visit the park. Dogs can then be "signed out" when they leave the park.
## This is a work in progress. It is not currently functional.
