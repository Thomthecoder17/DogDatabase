# DogDatabase
## Description:
A simple Flutter app to keep track of the number of dogs at a dog park. Dogs are manually "signed in" to a dog park by inputting the dog park's name, the number of dogs, and the names of the dogs. Signed in dogs will be visible to other users who are planning to visit the park. Dogs can then be "signed out" when they leave the park.

##Current Status:
Some simple UI had been added to view the dogs that have been signed in. There is no specific way to sign out the dogs, but each time dogs are signed in, the local file containing the dogs is completely rewritten. Dogs are not currently removed from the database when the file is rewritten. That being said, this project will be put to the side as I work on other projects. The database will be set to prohibit reads and writes altogether and the local file will be the only place the dogs are stored. 

##License:
There is no specific license on this project. Feel free to do whatever you want with this project and complete it yourself.
